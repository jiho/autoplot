Description: ggplot2 is a versatile plotting package which allows to produce
    almost any kind of plot from data stored as a data.frame, by combining unit
    elements. However, it requires the user to design the plot entirely, from
    scratch. Many R functions for statistical analyses (linear models,
    factorial analyses, etc.) output objects of a given class and allow to
    easily plot classic diagnostics using plot(), by defining a
    specialized method for this generic function. This package aims at
    reproducing this functionality in ggplot2 while benefiting from its
    improved versatility. It provides two sets of methods : (i) the
    fortify() methods extract data from the original object and
    format it as a data.frame; (ii) the autoplot() methods use these
    data.frames and leverage ggplot2 to produce diagnostic plots.
